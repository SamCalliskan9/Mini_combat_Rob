# Mini_combat_Rob 
İ made a project with basic attack &amp; light effect simulation. The project has decision structure, function, randomness, infinite loop etc.

## Basic Algorithms
•Decision structure
•Functions
•Randomness
•İnfinite loop

Project Summary 
This project demonstrates the movement system, attack damage system, lighting effects, basic loop - game loop, decision structures (if/else), randomness.
t is valuable in the portfolio because it includes movement + attack algorithm

## Run the Game
python Mini-combat_Rob
